# Treat App Manual

## Problem & Goal
Treat helps people manage indulgences without rigid dieting. The app tracks "treat" points against a daily recovery amount to keep users near the healthy 80% mark. Instead of counting calories, users record when they indulge and Treat shows how quickly they bounce back.

## Using the App
### Home screen
- **Meter** – shows current health percentage and quick stats: allowed budget, used points, and points left.
- **Floating buttons** – quickly log small, medium, or large treats for today. Use the undo button to remove the last quick entry.
- **Challenge accordion** – optionally run a strict challenge for a set horizon. The app calculates an allowance, tracks spending, and reports if the user stays on track.

### History view
- Open via *History* button.
- Use the date picker to choose any day.
- Mark treats or bonus recovery for the selected date.
- Each entry lists date, amount, and description (treat or recovery source).
- Import or export CSV to back up or restore history.

### Settings
- Adjust treat sizes (small, medium, large) and daily recovery amount.
- Manage habits: add, rename, delete, and set recovery value for each habit.
- Saving settings updates future calculations without changing past data.

## Feature Breakdown
- **Treat Meter & Rolling Window** – Treat stores every treat in a local history. The `stats` function examines a rolling window (default 30 days). Debt above a 20% allowance pushes the meter below 80%.
- **Daily Recovery & Habits** – The app subtracts a recovery amount each day. Completed habits grant bonus recovery equal to their value for that day. Bonuses stack with manual entries.
- **Streaks & Predictions** – `stats` also calculates current and best healthy streaks. If the user exceeds the allowance, the app estimates the date health returns to 80% based on daily recovery.
- **Challenge Mode** – A separate tracker with strict allowance and no decay. Users choose a horizon; Treat counts treats in that range and reports remaining budget.
- **Import/Export** – Export creates a JSON backup containing treat history, recovery and bonus logs, habits, and preferences for seamless migration. Import accepts this backup or a simple CSV of treat history; CSV rows merge into existing data and recovery is recalculated.
- **Offline-first PWA** – A service worker caches core files (`sw.js`) so the app works offline and updates in the background.

## Hidden Mechanisms
- **Local Storage Keys** – Treat persists data in localStorage: `mvp_points_v1` for treats, `mvp_prefs_v1` for settings, `mvp_recovery_hist_v1` for recovery changes, `mvp_bonus_hist_v1` for habit and manual bonuses, and `treat_habits_v1` for habit definitions.
- **Automatic Day Rollover** – A timer checks the date every minute. When the day changes, it recalculates bonuses, resets habit checkboxes, and re-renders stats.
- **Calculation Details** – `addPoints` stores positive numbers per day. `stats` walks the window, applying daily recovery before treats to model debt. Recovery rows record how much daily, habit, and manual recovery was applied.
- **Target Marker** – The meter marks 80% as the ideal point. The `describeTreat` helper converts raw points into small/medium/large descriptions.

## Developer Notes
- Single-page app (`index.html`) with inline JavaScript modules and CSS.
- Build/format checks: `npm test` runs the custom `lint.js` script.
- Service worker caching logic lives in `sw.js`.
- No external dependencies; everything runs in the browser.
